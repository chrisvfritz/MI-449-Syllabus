# Course description

MI449 makes use of the latest technologies in the web development world to teach practical coding skills with a focus on building cool stuff. The class will start with fundamentals, and branch out into more advanced concepts and tools. By the end of the class, you will be able to build your own full stack web applications, and apply the skills in the class directly towards your career.

## What we'll cover

### Web development foundation

We'll start out by building a base. You'll learn Git, HTML, CSS, how to load in external libraries like bootstrap, how to work with a development server, and a few more things that most any web developer we'll interact with regularly.

### Programming basics

After we get settled, we'll start with programming fundamentals using Javscript. Variables, functions, if statements, and events. 

### Working with data

Here we'll cover the basics of how data is used and interacted with. We'll cover arrays, loops, and objects using javascript.

### Different forms of data

This is a large section of the class, and lessons are still being decided on. Here we'll explore the many different forms data can take. We'll learn about data persistence, Node and NPM, APIs, writing database queries, HTTP, and we'll talk a little more in depth about servers.

### Branching off

From there you'll branch off in whatever direction you feel most interested in. You might learn about authentication, or dive deeper into SQL querying, learn some new build tools, tackle a framework, whichever direction you want to take.

### Honors options

If you're in the honors college, you have the opportunity to do another project for honors credit in this class. Get in touch with me in class or by email and we'll figure out a project to work on.

## What you'll take with you

This class will cover a lot of practical skills, and what we are most excited about it how you use them *after* you finish the semester. Here are a few things we hope you get out of this class:

### A base knowledge of coding and the web

The skills you'll be learning are much bigger than the context of this class. Coding in Javascript is actually a lot like coding in any other programming language, and when you go to work on a project in PHP or Ruby, you'll realize that you're not starting over at all. Connecting concepts takes time, but by the end of the class, you'll have a great base to branch off in whichever direction you'd like.

### A cool head when you're stumped

Coding can be frustrating, but getting stumped from time to time is just part of the process. You'll run into problems, your code will break, but you'll find a solution. If you can keep a cool head during all of this, it makes any problem you run into seem a lot more manageable.


### Resourcefullness in learning new things

Starting something new or learning a new skill can be really intimidating. In this class, you'll no doubt experience what it's like to try to learn something you know nothing about, and the more you do this, the easier it gets. By the end of the class, we want you to be excited to learn new things and start on new projects, because that's what coding is all about.

## Learning

### Self directed learning

In this class, you're able to choose the path you take through the lessons. Unlike a linear curriculum, you can branch off in whichever direction you'd like based on what you're most interested in learning. 

### Class format and mentors

Class will consist of 100% lab time, no lectures. The other mentors and I are here to help for that whole time, and our focus is completely on helping you. Coding is something that is often learned best independently, and the lab format allows you room to learn and explore independently with the aid of 3, sometimes 4 experienced mentors. Our purpose in the class is to help you grow. Ask questions, not just about class but about the professional world, the job market, entrepreneurship, anything. The possibilities that one class can open up may surprise you.

### Social Rules

In order to create an environment that cultivates growth and learning, there are a few general rules for interacting with others in the class:

1. Be kind, always
2. Don't be too cool for school
3. Go over [The Hacker School in New York Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)


## Grading

This class uses *formative assessment* to evaluate your learning. This means that you will start with a 0.0, and with every project you complete, your grade will go up. Once you reach a 4.0, you've reached your maximum grade and are free to stop, or try any other lessons you'd like. You'll be able to see your progress at any time on the course website.

When you submit a lesson, it will notify either the instructor or an assistant to review your code. If your assignment meets all the criteria, we will give you a shipit squirrel and you'll be free to move on. If there are things to fix, we'll send back what needs fixing and you will be able to try until you get it right. You'll never be permanently docked points for getting something wrong. You'll either get full credit, or make adjustments until you do.

### Cheating

Cheating will result in an automatic failure in the class. We encourage you to help each other and collaborate, but if you are copying each other's code or passing off another person's work as your own, that is cheating. If you are concerned about using code, it's always ok to ask.

### Absences

Absences have a 3-strike policy. We'll be doing a lot of our work online, but we'll also be doing a lot of work in class. The rule is 3 absences, explained or not, and you fail the course (again, unless there are very special circumstances). If you're more than 5 minutes late, that's counts for half an absence. We only have 14 classes. If you miss 3 of them, that's over 20%. What job are you allowed to not show up for 20% of the time?
